# Welcome to UneasyVanilla Github repo.

UneasyVanilla is a semi-anarchy/survival minecraft server, started on the 10th of March 2020, designed to give players total freedom to play Minecraft just as the developers intended.

We're not anarchy, rather more lawless than anything else. You can do whatever you want in-game as long as you follow a few simple rules.
